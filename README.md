# Open Solo Documentation
A temporary place to store documentation.  It's location will probably change once we setup a proper wiki.  The solo controller is often called "artoo" - that is what's primarily used in this documentation.

## [Building Open Solo (everything)](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/blob/master/SOLO-BUILDER.md)
If you want to build Open Solo, take a look at solo-builder [here](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/blob/master/SOLO-BUILDER.md).  It contains everything you need to build OpenSolo from scratch and update your artoo/solo. If you want to make customisations or build something specific take a look below.
> Note: solo-builder is producing corrupt artoo stm32 binaries for some users. See the [artoo docs](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/tree/master/artoo) if your artoo becomes "bricked" or doesn't turn on. (this is normally easily recoverable)

Nothing yet :(

## How to get involved
This documentation is pretty empty right now.  If you know how Solo or Artoo works (or don't know!) and want to get involved pull requests are welcome on this documentation and all of the sub projects. (artoo, solo-builder etc)  Most of the developers are hanging out on [gitter](https://gitter.im/ArduPilot/OpenSolo) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3DRSOLOModClub/).

## Special Mentions!
All of this would not be possible without 3DR.  They very generously open sourced most of their internal code and build tools to make this possible. You can see the official 3DR release statement [here](https://3dr.com/blog/announcing-opensolo/) and the ardupilot team's statement [here](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/opensolo-initiative-by-the-ardupilot-team).

Special thanks to Buzz and Peter for making this happen, and everyone else who has contributed to make solo even better.
