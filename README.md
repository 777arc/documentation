# Open Solo Documentation
A temporary place to store documentation.  It's location will probably change once we setup a proper wiki.  The solo controller is often called "artoo" - that is what's primarily used in this documentation.

## [Building Open Solo (everything)](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/solo-opensolo-quickstart.html)
If you want to build Open Solo, take a look at the [quick start guide](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/solo-opensolo-quickstart.html).  It contains everything you need to build all components of Open Solo from scratch and push it to your solo/artoo. If you want to make customisations or build something specific take a look below.
> Note: solo-builder is producing corrupt artoo stm32 binaries for some users.  Take a look below if your artoo becomes "bricked" or doesn't turn on.
