# Open Solo Documentation
A temporary place to store documentation.  It's location will probably change once we setup a proper wiki.  The solo controller is often called "artoo" - that is what's primarily used in this documentation.

## [Building Open Solo (everything)](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/blob/master/SOLO-BUILDER.md)
If you want to build Open Solo, take a look at solo-builder [here](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/blob/master/SOLO-BUILDER.md).  It contains everything you need to build OpenSolo from scratch and update your artoo/solo. If you want to make customisations or build something specific take a look below.
> Note: solo-builder is producing corrupt artoo stm32 binaries for some users. See the [artoo docs](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/tree/master/artoo) if your artoo becomes "bricked" or doesn't turn on. (this is normally easily recoverable)
