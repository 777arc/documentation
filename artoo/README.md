# Artoo Documentation
This folder contains all of the documentation for artoo.  It's fairly empty at the moment but expect more stuff shortly.

#### [How to build the artoo firmware](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/blob/master/artoo/build-artoo-firmware.md)
#### [How to flash the artoo firmware](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/blob/master/artoo/flash-custom-firmware.md)
#### [How to recover (soft) bricked artoo](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/blob/master/artoo/flash-custom-firmware.md#bricked-artoo)
> There *has not* been any reports of a hard bricked unit but it's always possible so be careful!
