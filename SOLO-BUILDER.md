# [Solo-Builder](https://github.com/OpenSolo/solo-builder)
This is the collection of scripts and tools that automatically build all of the firmware and operating system image files for your solo and artoo controller.  If you're not sure where to start, clone [this](https://github.com/OpenSolo/solo-builder) repository onto your computer.  Then follow the official OpenSolo [quick start guide](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/solo-opensolo-quickstart.html) on the ardupilot wiki.

An overview of the build process:
* Clone the repo
* Install all the prerequisites
* Bring up the vagrant virtual machine (ubuntu)
* Run the build (5-10 hrs on an i5)
* Flash solo's new image
* Flash artoo's new image
* Un-brick artoo if the screen doesn't turn on

More about un-bricking artoo can be found in the [artoo documentation](https://github.com/OpenSolo/documentation/tree/master/artoo).
